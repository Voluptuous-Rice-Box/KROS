## Crushed Dreams
(Things we wanted to do that we cannot)

* **Add a shared math library to the kernel**  
It is not possible to link shared libraries in the kernel. It is also not possible to do floating point operations in the kernel.

* **Use C++**  
We can't use C++ without shared libraries. We can't dynamically link libraries without loading. Loading is complicated.
